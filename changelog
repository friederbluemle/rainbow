I don't keep the best changelogs.  Remember you can always go to
hdiff.luite.com to compare different released versions.

0.28.0.2

  * Changed base dependency to version 4.8.  Also changed
  cabal-version to 1.10.

0.28.0.0

  * removed dependency on lens and replaced it with microlens-th and
  microlens.  This reduces the dependency graph a great deal.  I
  went with microlens rather than lens-simple because lens-simple
  ultimately depends on lens-family and lens-family2, and I do not
  know offhand what the "2" means and this was an issue when trying
  to figure out what Template Haskell functions to use (I know I can
  find out, but I don't care.)  The only disadvantage of this is
  that some types which used to have Wrapped instances no longer do.
  Data.Coerce reduces a lot of the pain of this though.

0.26.0.0

  * add color names to Types module

  * add Scheme

0.24.0.0

  * now uses Lenses; revamped API

0.22.0.0

  * no longer uses Terminfo.  Some breaking changes in how Chunks
    are printed.

  * added some more effects, such as italics

  * added some tests

0.16.0.0
  * overhauled how colors are stored; much simpler now.  However
    these changes will break old code.

0.14.0.2
  * Change dependency bounds
  * Change cabal generator to cartel

0.14.0.0

  * Change Chunk to hold a list of strict Text rather
  than just a single Text.
